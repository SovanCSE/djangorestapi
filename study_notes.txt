#what is mixins?
In Django Mixins is act like parent class.Main purpose to use this to always provide functionality
 support to the child class(to code usability puspose) not to any parent class(himself).It would
 not create object for himself.It always extends only object class not in other class by default
 if not pasing as object as well.It does content any instance variable only use to provide
 functioanlity to child class to creating object instance is meaning class.

 1. There is no point parent class instantiation.
 2. Parent class contains only instance methods not instance variable.
 3. The methods are useful for child class.
 4. Parent class should be direct throguh child class object.
